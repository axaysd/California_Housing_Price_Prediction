This repository contains Python code for analyzing and modeling housing data using various machine learning techniques. The code uses libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to perform data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

**Getting Started**
To run this code, follow the steps below:

a. Clone this repository to your local machine.

b. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

c. pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

d. Place your housing data CSV file named housing.csv in the same directory as the script.

e. Run the code using a Python interpreter.

**Code Overview**
The code can be broken down into the following main sections:

1. **Data Import and Initial Exploration**
Import necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Load the housing data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Perform initial data exploration, check for null values, and drop rows with missing data.
Split the data into independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (Y).
Split the data into training and testing datasets using train_test_split.
2. **Data Visualization**
Visualize the distribution of columns in the training dataset using histograms.
Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix of the training dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering**
Apply logarithmic transformation to skewed columns (total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households).
One-hot encode the categorical variable ocean_proximity.
4. **Further Data Visualization**
Visualize the correlation matrix again after feature engineering.
Create a scatterplot to show the relationship between latitude, longitude, and median house value.
5. **Feature Creation**
Create two new features: bedroom_ratio (proportion of bedrooms in a household) and household_rooms (average rooms per household).
6. **Regression Modeling**
Import the LinearRegression class and StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
Scale the features using StandardScaler.
Train a linear regression model on the original and scaled training datasets.
Apply logarithmic transformations to the test dataset features.
One-hot encode categorical variables in the test dataset.
Create the same new features (bedroom_ratio and household_rooms) for the test dataset.
Scale the test dataset features using StandardScaler.
Evaluate the performance of the linear regression models on the test dataset.
7. **RandomForestRegressor**
Import the RandomForestRegressor class from scikit-learn.
Train a RandomForestRegressor model on the scaled training dataset.
Perform a randomized search for hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.
Evaluate the performance of the tuned RandomForestRegressor model on the scaled test dataset.

**Conclusion**
This code provides a comprehensive example of data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and regression modeling using Python and popular machine learning libraries. It serves as a starting point for analyzing and modeling housing data, and can be further customized and extended to suit specific use cases and datasets. Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt this code for your own projects.
